# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This is another good project to start off as a beginner in Deep Learning.
The model takes an 28x28 image as an input and determines the digit which is handwritten in it.
There is a simple GUI made with Tkinter, with a canvas on which you can draw with your cursor the digit.
The answer will contain the class of the image (0, 1, 2, ..., 9) and the percentage.

The model is built with Keras, Tensorflow GPU 2.x, Tkinter.
