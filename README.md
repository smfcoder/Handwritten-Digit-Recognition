# Handwritten_Digit_Classifier_CNN

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. So, the MNIST dataset has 10 different classes.

Required libraries: pip install numpy, tensorflow, keras.

The Tkinter library comes in the Python standard library,have created a function predict_digit() that takes the image as input and then uses the trained model to predict the digit.

Then, created the app class which is responsible for building the GUI for our app,then created a canvas where we can draw by capturing the mouse event and with a button, we trigger the predict_digit() function and display the results.
